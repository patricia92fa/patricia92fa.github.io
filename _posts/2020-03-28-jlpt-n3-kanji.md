title: Kanji resources for JLPT N3
---

First stop, kanji.

You are expected to know around 650-700 kanji for JLPT N3.

When preparing for N5 and N4, I always tackled kanji first. I normally study vocabulary and kanji together, so 
resources will mix up both.

Without further ado, here's the plan:

**Resources**

- JLPT Study Kanji list: available [here](https://jlptstudy.net/N3/?kanji-list). Simple web interface with all kanjis 
at-a-glance. Various common vocabulary words for each kanji.
- The allmighty Memrise: I'm using [this](https://www.memrise.com/course/24172/jlpt-n3-vocab-with-audio/) course.
If you're an Anki person, go for it.
- Jisho online dictionary/Imiwa App for example sentences.
- Delvin Language for cramming vocabulary in context. Uses small clips from movies and tv shows.
- Todai app for reading practice. Just awesome. Has configurable furigana by JLPT level, spaced 
repetition decks per article. Includes news from NHK easy and many others.
- 日本語能力試験問題集N3読解スピードマスタ as reference book. Also has a companion Memrise course built by the community.
- ~~Animal crossing~~. Wait, what?

That's it. Probably will update this post after gathering some performance data.
Happy learning!
